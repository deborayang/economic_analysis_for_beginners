# R_economic_analysis_self-learning_course 
  My personal notes of R for statistic analysis. 
  It can be a self-study manual for students of economics/healthcare. 
  It contains three script files: 
  1. Bsics: Naming rules, data types (vectors, matrices, data frames, lists), data dimensions, indexes, mathematical operations, character operations, logical        operations, conditional and loop syntax, and custom functions. 
  2. DataProcess: Package management, data import and export, random numbers, rep, seq functions, sampling, filtering, sorting, generating new variables, long        data conversion, and merging. 
  3. DataAnalysis: Descriptive data analysis, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, linear regression, logistic model, and plotting.
     The dataset that used are from "https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv" and UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
  Note: Only file 3 is with fully English comments. I will change the other two files into full EN in June.
