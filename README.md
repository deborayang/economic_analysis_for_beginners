# R_economic_analysis_self-learning_course 
  My personal notes of R for statistic analysis. 
  It can be a self-study manual for students of economics/healthcare. 
  Contents of the files: 
    1_Bsics: Naming rules, data types (vectors, matrices, data frames, lists), data dimensions, indexes, mathematical operations, character operations, logical        operations, conditional and loop syntax, and custom functions. 
    2_DataProcess: Package management, data import and export, random numbers, rep, seq functions, sampling, filtering, sorting, generating new variables, long        data conversion, and merging. 
    3_DataAnalysis: Descriptive data analysis, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, linear regression, logit model, and plotting.
     The dataset that used are from "https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv" and UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
    4_ggplot_ggExtra: distribution of a single variable(distribution of continuous variables and categorical variables), multivariate relationship diagram(relationship between two variables, relationship between two categorical variables, relationship between categorical and continuous variables), scatterplot with additional variable distribution, variable correlation graph, and graphic details adjustment(title, subtitle, axis label, angle, range, and legend). 
  
    Note: Only file 3 is with fully English comments. I will change the other two files into full EN in June.
