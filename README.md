# R_economic_analysis_guidebook
My personal note of R for statistic analysis. 
Especially focus on the models and methods frequently used in economic analysis and healthcare research. 
Especially for the students who would like to learn R from the very basic to advanced level. 
It only contains three script files, by which allows you to learn fast.
